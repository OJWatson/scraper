> Scraping package with growing functionality

## What is this?

The BBC food website is not receiving further funding, and is being archived with no easy way to search for recipes 
etc. This package so far scrapes the recipe list, however as more scraping demands appear it seems sensible to store them 
somewhere

## Installing *waities* devel

To install the development version from github (the package *devtools is required*):

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("OJWatson/waities")
```
Note that on Windows, a toolkit ([Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)) needs to be installed separately for *devtools* to work. 

Once installed, the package can be loaded using:

```r
library(waities)
```

## Asking a question

- for bug reports, feature requests, contributions, use github's [issue system](https://github.com/OJWatson/waities/issues)
