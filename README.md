Installing *waities* devel
-------------
To install the development version from github (the package *devtools is required*):

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("OJWatson/waities")
```
Note that on Windows, a toolkit ([Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)) needs to be installed separately for *devtools* to work. 

Once installed, the package can be loaded using:

```r
library(waities)
```
