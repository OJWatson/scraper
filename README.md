> Scraping package with growing functionality

## What is this?

The BBC food website was not receiving further funding at one point, and was being archived with no easy way to search for recipes etc. This package so far scrapes the recipe list, however as more scraping demands appear it seemed sensible to store them somewhere

## Installing *scraper* devel

To install the development version from github (the package *devtools is required*):

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("OJWatson/scraper")
```
Note that on Windows, a toolkit ([Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)) needs to be installed separately for *devtools* to work. 

Once installed, the package can be loaded using:

```r
library(waities)
```
